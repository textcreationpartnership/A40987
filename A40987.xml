            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our <hi>Excellency</hi> beaming down lately some favour on your worthless Orator, invites this reflection of an humble gratitude. I am not ignorant how little leasure your most important, and now incumbent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires can allow you unto reading, and yet how much your zeal and piety enforces from them. This treatise is very little, the Title shews you the whole mind of it. It contains <hi>the strife of brethren,</hi> and <hi>a treaty for peace,</hi> it comes with confidence to kisse your hand, which the hand of the Allmighty hath made so notably instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall for the publique peace.</p>
                  <p>It was visible as the Sunne, how in every quarter of the Kingdome, the nets were spread for the godly, (how soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:102330:3"/>characterd under most unhappy notions of division.) Had not the holy watchman of <hi>Israel</hi> quickned your vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy and activity to breake those snares of death, from whence our soules are escaped. It is more then manifest to all that seek out the works of God [which all do that have pleasure therein] that the same arm, which cut <hi>Rahab</hi> and wounded the Dragon, hath not lesse wonderfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in your Armies, then in ages past, and by most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable providences hath determined the unkindly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that are amongst us.</p>
                  <p>And since the Highest hath so much honored you, it will be your happinesse, as your goodnesse, to study how to honour him. Amidst other opportunities, the Justice of your cause bespeaks the improvement of this, that your <hi>Excellency</hi> will be pleased to mediate unto the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to take care, that godly Ministers, whose hands lifted up in the Mount, have strengthned yours in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and the people, who have willingly offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, &amp; even undon themselves for the publique, be not a second time undon by those rigid taskmasters amongst whom they live; I mean such dis-affected Constables, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseers, and other Officers, who in proportioning pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique rates, impose the greatest burden upon the best-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, thereby endeavouring (if they might) to render your Armies, for whom the rates are collected, most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable unto those, to whom they are a protection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Josephus</hi> and <hi>Terentius</hi> in their respective ages, having favour for any request from the Emperours, aspired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for themselves, but improved all their interests for God, and for the Saints; the one petitioning the safety of sacred truths, the other the liberty of holy Professors.</p>
                  <p>And since I have assumed the boldnesse to beg, suffer me (most benigne Sir) to lie at your <hi>Excellencies</hi> feete with one suite more. In these labours which were expended on
<pb facs="tcp:102330:3"/>the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> I have with all humility and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of affection besought the Citie, to lay aside all discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and passion for a godly peace. And as Christians indeed, to bury all sense and suspition of injury in the grave of Christ. The same Petition I doe most humbly offer unto your <hi>Excellency:</hi> it is the glory of man to passe by offences. In great men it is greatest glory. It will be the choicest Diamond in the Diademe of your successes, to manage your power by a self-denying spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and humility.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>English</hi> Chronicle hath a notable passage between the King of <hi>England</hi> and the King of <hi>Wales,</hi> who after an hot dispute of the sword, appointed a treaty of peace at the river <hi>Severne,</hi> some discourse inclining to a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, these competitors in soveraignty became corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls in humility. The <hi>English</hi> King forced his horse into the river to offer the first imbraces unto his brother of <hi>Wales.</hi> The welsh-bloud being overcome with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired condescension, lighted from his horse and swam the streame to salute his Corrivall, with these words; <hi>Vicit humanitas tua injustitiam meam, invictissime Rex,</hi> I need not bring it neerer, your wisdome can see a far off.</p>
                  <p>But your <hi>Excellency</hi> hath as legible a Copie in your hand, as humane or sacred Story can afford. <hi>Abraham</hi> who was Uncle and foster-father unto <hi>Lot,</hi> in the strife between them was the first that sued for peace, and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded so farre in his own right, as that, though the whole Land were his by as cleere and sure a title, as the Lord Paramount of all the earth could make, yet he offers <hi>Lot</hi> to take his portion where he pleased, and for a godly peace was contented with his Nephews leavings.</p>
                  <p>Wee are now entring upon that great treaty of peace, by all that love <hi>Jerusalem</hi> most vigorously desired, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by some never well affected to the publique, too
<pb facs="tcp:102330:4"/>violently exacted, upon a designe; But the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible. Wisdome had a designe beyond theirs, season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to appoint it, when his goodnesse had put a blessed advantage into your <hi>Excellencies</hi> hand to be helpfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                  <p>There are three sister-graces, mentioned in this labour, which are inseparable from a well-grounded and lasting Peace. Truth, Justice, and Holinesse. Truth and peace, Justice and peace, Holinesse and peace, like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twins, will live and die together. I trust, that Victorious Sword in your <hi>Excellencies</hi> hand, will readily appeare with that two-edged sword in Christs mouth for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of these.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Simsons</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall History.</note> It was a brave resolution of <hi>Joane</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> to prefer safety of Conscience before assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of honours, Religion before life; and never to lay down Armes which shee had taken up for the Protestant Cause, but with one of these three Conditions: an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red peace, or an absolute victory, or an honest death. Wee trust the most holy Wisdome is now compassing the first of these, which, as it will be your vertue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, so your Crowne to subscribe.</p>
                  <p>Mean time, wee continue our devout breathings for your <hi>Excellency</hi> in that divine elegancy of the Royall Prophet; <hi>Gird thy Sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty—ride prosperously; because of truth, meeknesse, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and the right hand of God teach thee terrible things.</hi> FAXIT DEUS.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Text states the Times, the <hi>Condition</hi> of them, and the <hi>Desire</hi> of people in them. The <hi>Condition</hi> of them is very sad, and full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall strife; and that is the subject of the Text. The <hi>Desire</hi> of the people is strenuous, if not too furious, for a treaty of peace, and that is the end of the Text; and that is the end of this endeavour likewise: But that our desires be regular, &amp; the Treaty prove a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, I shall labour to hold out some light unto you from this <hi>Treaty,</hi> or rather <hi>Intreaty</hi> of peace between <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> wherein we have something supposed, and something proposed. That which is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be, or like to be, between <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> is an unbrotherly strife, <hi>Let there be no strife;</hi> and the occasion thereof is more then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, an indiscreet falling out between their Heardsmen: <hi>Let there be no strife between me and thee, nor between my Heardsmen and thy Heards<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> That which is proposed, is an effectuall endeavour for peace, and the Argument impelling it, is as powerfull as the endeavour proves effectuall: <hi>For we are brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are onely two generall Observations, which I shall hold
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102330:6"/>forth unto you from the Hypothesis and the Prothesis of the words.</p>
                  <p>The first is this, <hi>That there may be an unbrotherly strife betwen godly brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second this, That <hi>where such unbrotherly strife is, all possible and speedy means must be used for reconciliation: Let there be no strife between me and thee, nor between my Heardsmen and thy Heardsmen; Fore we are brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First then,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> Generall Doctrine.</note> That <hi>there may be on unbrotherly strife between godly bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doe you expect that I should prove this? I would the poynt were to prove; but it is past may be. It is too manifest, that there is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotherly strife between godly brethren. <hi>London, England,</hi> yea all <hi>England</hi> will give us in a teste to this truth. What County? What Citie? What Congregation? (yea the Lord be mercifull unto us) what Family scarce is there in the whole Kingdome, into which this Spirit of Division hath not breathed some malignant distemper? Here are two brethren in the Text, as neere as Nature, Society, and Religion could make them, whom neither native Countrey, nor te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious travell, nor pinching famine, nor threats of danger or distresse could separate; yet as you shall see in the sequell of this story, such an unhappy breach fell out between them, as that two such ancient and deere friends could not longer live together. Shall I shew you two others,<note place="margin">Acts 15.39.</note> who were brethren by Countrey, by Calling, and by Grace, united together in one joynt commission of Apostleship; and yet a very small matter occasioned such a sharp contention between them, as that those which had been very fast companions in love and labour, were provoked to part asunder. Between <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> the State peace was broken. Between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> the Church peace was broken. But <hi>Englands</hi> testimony to the Doctrine premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, goes beyond both those: For between our unkind brethren, whom yet on both sides we cannot but beleeve, some to be truly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both State peace, and Church peace, is not onely broken, but bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all in pieces; and so broken, as that it is even past the skill of man to find out a way to heale our breaches, unlesse a Divine Arme put in to doe it.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Reasons of these unbrotherly differences, wee shall find enough in the Text, and need not look beyond it, nor indeed will time permit. The Message of this morning exercise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like that of the Prophets servant, so exceeding <hi>hasty,</hi> as that it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102330:6"/>will not suffer us to <hi>salute</hi> any thing that lies besides the direct way of the Text. In the Text then we find three occasions or grounds. 1. In the persons between whom this unbrotherly strife is. 2. In their Heardsmen, amongst whom the strife began. 3. In the cause which provoked the falling out among the Heardsmen.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the persons between whom this unbrotherly strife is:<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> Grace there was without question, but there was Nature too, the second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had his image in them; but the image of the first was visible al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: they and we, and every supernaturall birth, have dividing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in us. We are not all <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the good Angels, that there should be no division; nor all <hi>Flesh,</hi> as the unregenerate,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.25.</note> that there should be no reconciliation; but we are partly <hi>Flesh,</hi> and partly <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that look how much the <hi>Flesh</hi> provokes unto division, so much should the <hi>Spirit</hi> incline unto reconciliation. Who among all the sonnes of <hi>Sion,</hi> doe not with <hi>Rebecca</hi> complain,<note place="margin">Gen. 25.22.</note>
                     <hi>How is it thus with me?</hi> because of these Twins struggling in the wombs of their consciences: But though corruption should put out first, with <hi>Esau,</hi> and make the breach, yet let grace, as <hi>Jacob,</hi> take it by the heele, and get the blessing.</p>
                  <p>But besides these dividing principles that are within, there are many occasions which doe irritate without; I doe not forget that I have confined my selfe to those in the Text: and in the opening of them, I shall give you out such observations as they offer to us, with some short applications, and then shall make them subservient to the generall Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The second cause then which provoked this strife between <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> was the falling out amongst their Heardsmen. <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Contentious servants may and doe often cause unhappy broyles between their Governours,</hi> as here <hi>Abrams</hi> and <hi>Lots</hi> Heardsmen fell out about common of pasture. So in <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.14. <hi>Isaacs</hi> and <hi>Abimelechs</hi> servants strove about Wells of water. And that the quarrels of servants invade their Governours, <hi>Reasons</hi> may be, either 1. their too much connivance at their exorbitant courses. Private Families are the fountaines of Ministery and Magistracy, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102330:7"/>if the fountaines be corrupt, that there be neither instruction nor correction of youth there, what hope is there that the streames shall ever doe good upon them. Or 2<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>, too much compliance with their corrupt opinions. We soon spy out such faults in our Families, as are against our own gain, but such errors as are against the Faith and Truth of Jesus Christ, we easily tollerate. Or 3<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>, too much indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their talings, and busie medlings. There is a disease of the eare in many Families, which itcheth after tales, and those that are troubled with it, shall hardly ever be free from trouble; its a pregnant signe that they are too invigilant over their own wayes and affaires, who are too busie in medling with others. Or 4<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>, which is worst of all, when Governours doe too wickedly sport themselves in the proud contentions of their servants,, as <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Joab,</hi> who would have their <hi>young men play be fore them.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 2.14.26.</note> Bloody quarrels are but a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime to men of blood: but they bethought themselves, and saw, <hi>it would be bitternesse in the end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold how great a flame a little fire hath kindled in that famous Citie and Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>1</label> that destructive Sword that hath so lately <hi>eaten so much flesh, and drunke so much blood</hi> in that opulent State, was first drawn (as is reported) through the tumult of a few idle servants. But we need not goe so far either for time or place. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how great a flame a little fire was like to have kindled here in <hi>London,</hi> but some few moneths past, by the tumultuous carriages of some Apprentises upon the Lords day,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>April</hi> 9. 1648.</note> if divine mercy had not been propitious unto <hi>London,</hi> by a speedy providence to prevent the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (and I feare intended) mischiefe. Your servants have gotten an unhappy principle amongst them, that they must have liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to attend on what Ordinance they please on the Lords day; and some under this pretence, take liberty for their lusts to attend on none. Where hath the Lord of Sabbaths discharged the account of masters of Families, not onely for him that serveth, but for him that sojourneth in the House? And; O my friends, how much was the Lord of Sabbaths and his Ordinances honored when our Tribes with their servants did march in good array unto the Temple of the Lord? A great complaint there is every where of bad servants, but let Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overnors of families lay their hands on their own hearts, and see if the sault be not mostly their own, who take no more care to make their servants good. I know well that all Governours have not ability alike to provoke their servants unto good; but all have authority alike to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102330:7"/>keep them from evill: And if they be not as Eagles to carry them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their wings to heaven, yet they should be as Sparrowes to lead them unto Gods House. <hi>Solomon</hi> did so order his Family, as that the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did think them happy that lived under his roofe: you have the choycest youth of all the families in <hi>England</hi> intrusted with you in your City, if they should miscarry through your neglect, how publick, how great will that mischiefe be?</p>
                  <p>But secondly, I would apply, and do heartily wish, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> that holy care and resolution to be taken up by Governours, which the Kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet for himselfe protested, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101.3, 4. <hi>To hate the work of them that turne aside, and to part with those that are of a froward heart;</hi> nay, if they be children as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> were, who by their unhappy brawles, doe make their parents <hi>to stinke</hi> amongst their neighbours, learne from the good old Patriarch, to disavow their combinations; and conclude with thine own foule as he did; <hi>O my soule come not thou into their secret, unto their assembly mine honour be not thou united,</hi> Gen. 49.6. At least as the Father of the faithfull did here: set thy grace and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome on work to the utmost, timely to take up contentions. <hi>Let there be no strife between mee and thee, neither between my servants, and thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; for wee are Brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is now the first Consideration of the Herdsmen in their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as servants. Their second Consideration is in their calling as Shepheards, and here as <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> were the representative of the Church, so spare me a little to look upon their Shepheards, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative of Church-Shepheards: and here is another cause of this unbrotherly strife. The note I give you is this; that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The personall questions of some Pastours,</hi>

And observe what the cry is there: <hi>I am for Paul,</hi> saith one, nay but <hi>Apollo</hi> is for my money, saith another, yea but <hi>Cephas</hi> is a man for mee saith the third; I care for none of your Ministers, saith a fourth; I can live immediately upon the revelations of Jesus Christ, and have no need of Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>Now what is all this a doe, but the peoples affections, breaking out into factions; their severall sidings with their gifted Ministers, whose parts and opinions they did admire, and adhere unto. Or will you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102330:8"/>vouchsafe to look into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and take notice there, of that <hi>divided multitude,</hi> before the High Priests Judgement-seate, where for the <hi>hope of Israel</hi> S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                     <hi>Paul stood bound,</hi> Act. 23.6. It was an honest policy the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle used to allay the storme of the people by discovering his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the point of the <hi>Resurrection;</hi> Hereupon <hi>there arose a dissention between the Pharisees and Sadduces,</hi> and presently saith the Text, <hi>the multitude was divided.</hi> See, the disputes of their Rabbies quickly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the severall parties of their Proselytes, and the grounds are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible why it is so, either opinion is so headdy in the people, or affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so blinde, or desire of victory so importunate, as that questions howsoever, or upon what pretence soever taken up, yet they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hotly, <hi>&amp; non sine felle,</hi> not without too much gall over-stifly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and pursued, not so much for Christ, for truth, or for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as for selfe, for conquest, and for vaine-glory.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102330:8"/>of pastures through the enlargement of their flocks, there was not <hi>room enough</hi> for the one and for the other. And this is it indeed, the third or fourth cause of our Church-contentions, this <hi>common of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures and want of elbow-room</hi> amongst Pastors for the enlargement of their flocks.

                  <p>From hence my Beloved, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>1</label> let me borrow time to-lay before you two notes of information.</p>
                  <p>First, The primitive rise of Episcopacy or Prelacy. The office of Bishop and Elder is not differenced in Scripture; for those whom the Spirit calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Over-seers</hi> or <hi>Bishops,</hi> Act. 20. ver. 28. In ver. 17. of the same Chapter, are called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Elders;</hi> and so compare <hi>Titus</hi> 1. ver. 5. and 7 But pride and ambition made the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, the Bishop and Prelate by an usurpation of jurisdiction, and through the favour of Princes, accumulated titles of honour, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives unto themselves above their brethren. This mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie began in the Apostles time;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.24. 1 Pet. 5 3. James 3.1. 1 Joh. 2.18.</note>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> hinteth at such as usurped <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over Brethrens faith; Peter</hi> such as <hi>Lorded it over Gods heritage; James</hi> such as aspired <hi>Masteries; John, many Antichrists,</hi> who <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes</hi>-like, <hi>loved preheminence,</hi> I feare, least some aspiring unto Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals may have too much in them of the Cathedrall mans spirit, in this time of reformation I could heartily wish amongst reformers, the spirit of pride and envie to be laid aside. And let us all, my Brethren, in all humility and love bespeak one the other, as <hi>Abram</hi> did <hi>Lot; Let there be no strife between thee and mee, for wee are brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The mischief see, of encreasing flocks, and greatning estates, <hi>Abrams</hi> and <hi>Lots Shepheards</hi> could well enough agree together so long as their flocks and means were small; but when they grew great, both their flocks and families and themselves must separate. How many of you in this Citie doe well know, how well the Pastor and Lecturer (I name no particulars) could in one Congregation hold common of pasture and peace together, so long as the ambition of Prelates kept theirs down; but since the Indulgence of these times hath given liberty for common of pasture in any Congregation, our peace is not onely broken, but our differences, though really very small, yet seemingly so wide, as that they cannot be stated, nor desires known to make way for a reconciliation. <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his 8. Booke 1. Chapter of his Ecclesiasticall History, gives us as lively a character of these times by those he liv'd in, as if he had lived in both. I have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102330:9"/>not time to repeat his discourse, I shall desire you that are vers'd in History at your leasure to reade it.</p>
                  <p>But I should here look a little more abroad unto State-contentions,<note place="margin">Reader I have inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a tast of it.</note> as well as Church-contentions. It is sad to see what unchristian, uncivill, unnaturall contentions,<note place="margin">They which seemed our Shepheards, laying aside the rule of pietie, practised con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and schisme among themselves, And whiles they aggravated these things, that is, contention, threatnings, mutuall hatred and enmitie; And every one proceeded in ambition, much like tyranny it selfe; then, I say, then the Lord according to the saying of <hi>Jeremy, made the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sion obscure, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew from above the glory of Israel, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred not his footstoole in the day of his wrath,</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>2.1.</hi>
                     </note> this question of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> mine and thine, doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get amongst us. What is reported of the Gospel to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce by accident, that doth the world efficaciously work as an efficient: <hi>To set a man at variance against his Father, the daughter against her Mother, and the daughter in law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her mother in law, and a mans foes to be those of his own houshold.</hi> Full purses are usually the bellowes, which pride and passion make use of to blow up strife amongst neerest friends, nor can wee see, nor will wee see our way to peace, till our purses be a little emptied.</p>
                  <p>I have not time to stay longer on this; the generall Doctrine calls upon mee for a word of application. You have heard, that <hi>there may be unbrotherly strife between godly brethren,</hi> yea that it is past may be, you have seen antient &amp; modern witnesses that it is so, with the evident grounds and causes thereof.</p>
                  <p>Shall I then my Brethren, take up a reproofe, or rather a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse. </seg>
                     </label> over those imbittered censures, which godly brethren let fall one against the other? Are wee brethren? Are wee godly? I am confident, that it may be safely concluded, that some on both sides, are brethren truely godly. Why then, why are wee so bitter one against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? What means the gall and wormwood that is in our discourses and meetings? Ah my Brethren, my Brethren, did our Lord Christ wash his Apostles feete, and amongst them a <hi>Judas</hi> feete,<note place="margin">John 13.12.</note> and shall we throw dirt in one anothers faces? Is this Christ-like? doth this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Christians?<note place="margin">Eph. 2.13, 14.</note> Did he powre out his precious <hi>bloud</hi> to purchase our <hi>peace,</hi> and shall wee draw out one anothers bloud in breaking our peace? Did he bequeath <hi>his peace</hi> unto his people,<note place="margin">John 14.27.</note> as his last and best Legacy he had to leave unto them, and shall wee like foolish children spend our portion in undoing one the other?</p>
                  <p>But I will forbeare this ingratefull rebuke, being more willing, if time would permit, to travaile in the second generall, <hi>The treatie for Peace;</hi> But I may not forget my limits and your affaires; onely for close of this, I shall turn you unto two Counsels of the Apostle.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:102330:10"/>
                  <p>The first is given unto the brethren at <hi>Rome, Rom.</hi> 16. vers. 17. <hi>Now I beseech you Brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the doctrine which yee have learned, and avoyde them.</hi> And if you will mark farther, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. the Apostle doth there manifest such pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar marks whereby you may know them, and not be deceived. Which I had rather you should there reade your selves, then I repeat unto you, least they should be interpreted rather to be the words of mans spirit, then the words of the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>The second is that which the Apostle with much tendernesse of bowells and affection pressed on his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in his first Epistle, first Chapter, and tenth verse. <hi>Now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that yee all speak the same things, and that there be no divisions among you, but that yee be perfectly joyned together in the same minde, and in the same judgement.</hi> And now I beseech you brethren, this is also my sute to you, and I cannot conjure you by a greater <hi>name,</hi> then that by which <hi>alone</hi> you must <hi>be saved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have another sute likewise for you in the words of the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Now the God of peace himselfe give you peace alwayes, by all meanes.</hi> Our breaches are so wide, that if the <hi>Lord of peace</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe doth not give us <hi>peace,</hi> it is beyond the understanding of man to compasse it. And our wastings are so great, as that <hi>Peace</hi> is <hi>by all meanes</hi> most desirable; yea and by all men most desired. Our second labour is to perswade and to direct unto this.</p>

                     <hi>all possible and speedy meanes must be used for reconciliation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not light a candle to this Sunne, both Nature and Nation, Civility and Morality, Profession and Religion, Truth and Christ bespeake this duty from us. There are no counsels so obvious in Gods word, as those which perswade to brotherly amity, to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an unity, to peace, a grace to peace, a blessing to peaceablenesse
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102330:11"/>and peace-making both in civil and in Ecclesiasticall differences, to a wise and speedy reconciliation of all offences.</p>
                  <p>The Arguments are likewise manifest and manifold, which the Sword of the Spirit, or rather the Spirit of the Sword useth as a keen edge to cut off contentions, and to provoke unto love. How patheticall and full of affection are those Arguments of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, Philip. 2. v. 1, 2, 3. <hi>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the same love, being of one mind. Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory.</hi> Me thinks the Apostles soule and words flow out together, as he sayes else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, 1 Thess. 2.8. <hi>We are willing to impart not the Gospel onely, but our own soules, because you are deare unto us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What a heap of unities doth the Apostle pile up in Ephes. 4. v. 4, 5, 6. <hi>One Body, one Spirit, one hope of our Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme, one God and Father of all, which is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi> And now what is all this <hi>Onenesse</hi> but to make us <hi>One,</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell Saints into <hi>the unitie of the Spirit, and bond of peace?</hi> If all be <hi>one,</hi> why should brethren be <hi>two?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What mighty convictions doth the Apostle hold forth from Natures light in 1 Cor. 12. shewing how the united services of all the members in the body naturall, doe tutour the uniting of Christians, and of all their offices, parts and gifts for the service of the body my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall. <hi>Variety</hi> of gifts are not bestowed on us to work <hi>contrariety</hi> of affection: It is a sublime notation of unity which the Apostle there gives, v. 12. calling the Head and the Body one Christ, plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that such who wilfully rend themselues from the body, doe as much as in them lies to rend themselves also from the head.</p>
                  <p>But what need I step beyond the Text for impulsives to inforce the duty of the Doctrine? Two I here find, one above the Text, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the foot of it, <hi>Let there be no strife between thee and me, neither between thy Heardsmen and my Heardsmen,</hi> saith <hi>Abram</hi> to <hi>Lot,</hi> and why? 1. <hi>Because the Cananite and the Perezite dwell in the land.</hi> 2. <hi>Because we are brethren.</hi> Let us now examine these reasons, and</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Because of the Canaanite and Perezite which dwell in the Land,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> as if <hi>Abram</hi> should have said, Why brother <hi>Lot,</hi> doe you not see that there is a generation of ungodly men dwelling amongst us, who would willingly take the advantage from our divisions to work us both out of this good land? <hi>I pray thee</hi> therefore brother, <hi>let there be no strife</hi> between us.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102330:11"/>
                  <p>Why but some will say, Whom doe you mean by these <hi>Canaanites and Perezites?</hi> I'le shew you what Characters the Spirit of God doth hint unto us of them, The <hi>Canaanite</hi> is derived from that cursed seed, who did mock at his Fathers nakednesse, you have the story in <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.25. The <hi>Perezite</hi> from an Hebrew root which signifies to divide. Both of these mischievous enough to the power of godlinesse, and to the peace of the Gospel. The <hi>wilde Boare</hi> and the <hi>little Foxes</hi> doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great (though not equall) hurt unto the Spirituall <hi>Vine:</hi> the <hi>little Foxes</hi> spoyle her grapes; but the <hi>wild Boare</hi> would root it up.

                  <p>But what doe you tell us of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and the <hi>Perezites,</hi> are there any such dwelling in our land?</p>
                  <p>My brethren, I accuse none here, but I am very certain you will all beare me witnesse that there is a generation of <hi>Canaanites</hi> in the land, which scoffe at Saints, at Ministers, at Profession, at Ordinances, and would scoffe at Jesus Christ himselfe, if he were alive, who doe not onely triumph in such nakednesses as they see, but with those in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah, they pull off the beautifull garment from them that passe by them peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mica. 2.8.</note> they study all the mischiefes they can, to render Religion, and the professors thereof odious.</p>
                  <p>There is another generation of <hi>Perizzites</hi> in the land, who like <hi>Samsons Foxes</hi> have <hi>fire brands at their tailes,</hi> who make it their designe to divide, that they might rule. I mean not such, who through tendernesse of conscience, or upon misgiving grounds, doe separate, but I meane the politick <hi>Perizzite,</hi> who is set on work by <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> to retard the counsels of Reformation through the divisions of brethren. For is not the hand of <hi>Joah</hi> in all this? Hath not the Divell and the Jesuit made it their Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece by most unhappy divisions to break the strength of that party by whom God hath broken theirs? yea and I am perswaded, that there are many truly godly, who are imployed by them as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that are altogether inscious of any designe: as <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> imployed those honest Philosophers in those two famous Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> to make several parties in them, that he might be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in to make himselfe master of both.<note place="margin">Qu. Curtius, lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> And as the same <hi>Philip</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided the controversie of the Kingdome of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> between those two discording brethren who contended for it, which he fairly took from both.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:102330:12"/>
                  <p>Oh that we could undermine the gates of <hi>Rome</hi> and Hell this day, by our most happy uniting. Me thinkes there is no argument that can have more force in it then this, when we know that there are such generations of men amongst us, who doe wait for this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to break in upon us through the lane of our divisions, and to raise their decayed fortunes on our miserable ruines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tully</hi> in his <hi>Offices</hi> presents us with a very pat story to cautionate the unbrotherly discord of these times.<note place="margin">Tull. de Offis. lib. <hi>1.</hi>

My brethren, let us be well advised, lest whilst we doe most unhappily contend about the confines of our priviledges and liberties, our good friends of <hi>Rome</hi> doe not come in and give us as much sensuall liberty as we desire, but take away from us those saving Gospel truths, and that purity and power of Ordinances which lie between us <hi>in medio,</hi> on both sides contended for.</p>
                  <p>The second Argument that lies at the foot of the Text, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> is the force of brotherhood: <hi>For wee are brethren,</hi> and wee are brethren many wayes: 1. We are <hi>brethren</hi> by Countrey,</p>

Ah my brethren, doe we need such a rod to whip us into the sense of brotherly love? Surely the provocations of sonnes and daughters are greatest provocations, and our heavenly Father hath provocations enough to turn us all out of doores when we cannot live peaceably together in his house.</p>
                  <p>But 2<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>, brethren by blood, as some of us are, and brethren by grace, as <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> were, children of the same <hi>beauenly Father,</hi> partakers of the same <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> begotten of the same <hi>immortall seed,</hi> bred up in the same <hi>houshold of Faith,</hi> made to drink into one and <hi>the same Spirit,</hi> partakers of the same <hi>heavenly Calling,</hi> heires to the same <hi>immortall inheritance,</hi> and bound up together in the same <hi>bundle

                  <p>Beloved, we should all <hi>love as brethren,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.8.</note> as genuinely and naturally as brethren, that's our Rule; but if we cannot hold proportion with the Rule, to love as brethren, yet let us keep correspondency with the object, to <hi>love the Brotherhood.</hi>

Abram</hi> was the elder and nobler of the two here, both in place and parts, and yet he is the first that sues for reconciliation: wee heare not in his mouth the language of these times; Sir, I am your elder, and your better, I look that you should stoop to mee; I wonder Sir, that you will suffer your servants to fall out with mine; why? have not I bred you up from a boy? have you not gotten all that you have under mee? and what common of pasture can your Shepheards challenge, but what they have at my courtesie? Nay, No such language you heare from <hi>Abram,</hi> he that <hi>saw Christs day,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The second Rule is this; Christians must be content to yeeld in their own right for a godly peace, whose right was ever clearer or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to the whole Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> then <hi>Abrams</hi> was? he had it all made over to him and to his posterity from the Lord Paramount <hi>of the whole Earth,</hi> and yet when this strife fell out between <hi>Abrams</hi> and <hi>Lots</hi> Shepheards about common of pasture, he propounded unto <hi>Lot</hi> his choice of any part of the whole Land that was before him, and would content himselfe with <hi>Lots</hi> leavings. <hi>See,</hi> saith <hi>Abram, is not the whole Land before thee, separate thy selfe,</hi> I <hi>pray thee, from mee,</hi> (not that <hi>Abram</hi> was willing to part with <hi>Lot,</hi> but that they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that brotherly union at a distance, which they could not keep, by keeping together,) <hi>If thou wilt take the left hand</hi> (saith <hi>Abram</hi> to <hi>Lot,</hi>) <hi>then I will goe to the right, or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will goe to the left.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Lots</hi> eye was so great upon the <hi>fat and pleasant vallies of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> as that forgetting his good manners to his Uncle, he made his choice, and <hi>Abram</hi> lost nothing by his condescention unto him;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102330:13"/>for as soon as <hi>Lot</hi> was separated from him, the Lord appeares unto <hi>Abram,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 15.</note> and renews his promise of the <hi>whole Land to him and to his seed.</hi> See, my Brethren, God will not suffer us to be loosers in any thing, wherein for his sake, we deny our selves and our own right, in order to a religious peace.</p>
                  <p>If our Brother <hi>Lot</hi> hath a minde to the fat and pleasant portion of <hi>Sodom,</hi> let him take it, surely if his designe be profit and not peace, the Lord will finde a time to <hi>fire</hi> him out of it againe; it matters not what we suffer in our own particular interests, so as God might have his glory in a godly peace. Were there more of <hi>Abrams</hi> condescenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongst us, how easily might our unhappie differences be taken up.</p>
                  <p>The third Rule is;<note place="margin">Rule <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> That in order to peace all expostulations and exprobrations of injuries be laid aside. Wee heare nothing from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> of any unkindnesse, but onely a loving and humble intreatie; <hi>Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between thee and mee.</hi> The repeating of an old wrong, is but as the rubbing upon an old sore, which doth but anger it, and make the cure the worse.</p>
                  <p>It is an holy art of forgetfulnesse to be forgetfull of injuries. I would there were graves made, <hi>Domicilia silentij,</hi> houses of silence, between King and Parliament, between Parliament and Citie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Cide and Army, between our diffenting brethren, and all those that upon sober and religious grounds, doe discent from them, to bury all passions and suspicions of injuries; and let these graves be <hi>Kibroth Hattaavab,</hi> graves of lust, I meane,<note place="margin">Kibroth Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taavah. <hi>Numb. 11.34.</hi>
                     </note> to bury all those corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have provoked these unkindnesses.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, you doe all professe your selves to be <hi>Abrams chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> inheritours of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hose promises, which were made to him, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Christs argument doth as much concern the <hi>children by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> as the <hi>children by flesh; if you are Abrams children,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 8.39.</note>
                     <hi>you will then doe the works of Abraham:</hi> Amongst others forget not these which I have shewed you.</p>
                  <p>There are two other Rules now, which though they be not in the Text, yet they doe belong unto the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The first is this; There are three beautifull Sisters, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which are inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable companions unto this happy heavenly off-spring, I meane a religious and well-grounded peace.</p>
                  <p>The first is <hi>Truth, Love the truth and peace,</hi> Zach. 8.19. ver. Love <hi>peace,</hi> but <hi>truth</hi> with it, <hi>truth</hi> before it. If you let goe <hi>truth, peace</hi> will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102330:14"/>not be worthy your love, you love <hi>peace,</hi> because it is the mother of plenty, but if you provide not for <hi>truth,</hi> to dwell with it, your <hi>peace</hi> will prove the daughter of vanity, your <hi>peace</hi> can be neither true nor lovely, that is separated from the love of the <hi>truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second is <hi>Righteousnesse. Mercy and truth are met together, righteousnesse and peace have kissed each other,</hi> Psal. 85.10. In that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table meeting of the divine attributes in Jesus Christ, these two <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and peace</hi> are matcht together, no <hi>righteousnesse</hi> can procure our <hi>peace</hi> with God, but the <hi>righteousnesse</hi> of Jesus Christ, and no <hi>peace</hi> can stand with men, unlesse the influences of that <hi>righteousnesse</hi> be upon them. If <hi>unrighteousness</hi> be found in our Parliament, in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, in our Courts of Judicature, in your Citie, and in your shops, the Land be not purged of bloud, and Justice be not done upon the <hi>Aebans,</hi> the troublers of our <hi>peace,</hi> our <hi>peace</hi> will be forced to depart againe as soone as it is procured.</p>
                  <p>The third is <hi>Holinesse: Follow peace with all men and holinesse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no man shall see the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. <hi>Follow peace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> joyntly, but not equally. <hi>Peace</hi> for <hi>holinesse</hi> sake, and <hi>holinesse</hi> above <hi>peace;</hi> for this is implyed in the force of the reason: <hi>for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holinesse no man shall see the Lord.</hi> Wee may <hi>see the Lord</hi> without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>peace</hi> with all men, but not without the having of <hi>holinesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let there be no strife between thee and mee,</hi> saith <hi>peace</hi> to <hi>truth, peace</hi> to <hi>righteousnesse, peace</hi> to <hi>holinesse;</hi> But let there be nothing but strife between me and thee, saith <hi>peace</hi> to <hi>error, peace</hi> to <hi>injustice, peace</hi> to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse.</hi> And if any Minister should be so bold to <hi>separate those whom God hath joyned,</hi> or to <hi>joyn</hi> those whom God hath <hi>seperated,</hi> he should indeed preach sedition, but not against proud man, as is suggested, but against a holy and a jealous God. That true-righteous-holy-Peace, that blessed daughter of Heaven will certainly forbid all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts that shall be published between <hi>error, injustice, prophanenesse,</hi> and her selfe, <hi>there is no peace to the wicked, saith my God,</hi> nor no peace with the wicked. Or if it were possible that Peace should own such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, Christ himselfe, who is the <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> would never own her for his daughter;<note place="margin">Matth. 10.34.</note> for in this case he saith, <hi>I came not to send peace on the earth, but the sword.</hi> In a word, let goe either of these sister-gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and your peace, be it what it will, it will undoe you. This is now the first Rule in order to a godly peace.</p>
                  <p>The second I have to lay before you is this, That if we will needs be striving, let <hi>Massah</hi> and <hi>Mcribah,</hi> those <hi>waters of strife</hi> run in their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102330:14"/>right channels. The way to break a designe of warre, is many times to divert it; to break the strength of our unhappie contentions, I would fix them upon their true and proper objects. There are two which I shall propound unto you, 1. That which you should contend for. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 2. That which you should contend against. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, That which you should contend for, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is that to which <hi>Jude</hi> exhorts you, <hi>Jude</hi> 2. that you should <hi>earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints.</hi> There is <hi>faith</hi> a grace, and <hi>faith</hi> the object of that grace. <hi>Faith</hi> a grace is that whereby wee close with all divine revelations, not onely by a consent unto the truth of them in our understandings, but by a taste of the sweetnesse of them in our wills and affections; and those divine revelations are also called <hi>the faith of Saints:</hi> because they are those things which <hi>Saints</hi> by <hi>faith</hi> doe live upon: now <hi>Saints</hi> must contend for both; but that which <hi>Jude</hi> doth here intend, is <hi>the doctrine of faith;</hi> and for this wee must <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>contend,</hi> above all that strength wee contend with. The word is a compound, borrowed from those that did strive for masteries in the Olympick games, whose strife was vigorous as for life, yet heere wee must strive above that, and wee have a supernaturall strength given unto us to strive with; wee must put forth all that which Nature or Grace can minister unto us. Our lives must not be deare unto us, or any thing that is dearer then our lives, to preserve those saving truths which are the purchase of so many Martyrs bloud, yea of the precious bloud of the Sonne of God, our new Testament is the <hi>new Testament of his bloud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three energeticall arguments in this perswasive of <hi>Jude,</hi> inciting the duty he perswades unto.</p>
                  <p>First, The transcendent excellency of that which wee contend for.</p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <p>Secondly, The mighty opposition which is against it.</p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, The irreparable losse of it being once gone.</p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <p>First, The transcendent excellency of that which wee contend for, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> worth all the expence of all that labour, treasure, and bloud, which it hath cost this Kingdome. It is the Imperiall <hi>gift,</hi> the <hi>treasury,</hi> the <hi>inheritance of Saints. Naboth</hi> would rather part with his life, then with his inheritance, but an inheritance of a life immortall, how much is it to be preferred before a mortall life, or inheritance. It is storied of <hi>Troy,</hi> that in the <hi>Grecian</hi> siege it had an Oracle, that if it could keepe its <hi>Palladium,</hi> the image of their Goddesse of Wisdome, their Citie should not be lost. Beloved, this is our <hi>Palladium,</hi> loose it, and loose
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102330:15"/>all.<note place="margin">Compare Ezek. 9.3. with 11.23. so 10.2. with 11.11. 1 Tim. 1.19, 20.</note>
                     <hi>The glory of God</hi> in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Visions, did soone <hi>depart</hi> from the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> when it was once <hi>departed</hi> from the <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> If the Lord take <hi>coales from the Altar,</hi> to scatter over the <hi>Citie,</hi> the Judgement of it shall speed after with a vengeance. When <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander did make shipwrack of faith,</hi> they made shipwrack of a <hi>good Conscience</hi> with it. It was the great Comfort of <hi>Pauls</hi> Conscience upon his death-bed, that <hi>he had kept the Faith,</hi> and his keeping the faith was the main prop of his Confidence,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.7, 8.</note> that <hi>from thenceforth there was laid up for him a Crowne of righteousnesse.</hi> If you let goe faith, you loose your <hi>comfort,</hi> your <hi>confidence,</hi> your <hi>crowne:</hi> If therefore you will contend, <hi>contend as earnestly</hi> as you will for this. <hi>Contend for the Faith once given to the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second Argument to provoke unto this <hi>holy contention,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is the <hi>mighty opposition</hi> which <hi>Saints</hi> finde against the <hi>faith,</hi> therefore would the Apostle have us <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>contend earnestly;</hi> so wee translate It, but that is too low, you must more then contend; us <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in another sense,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.3.</note> not onely <hi>according to your power, but beyond your power:</hi> The doctrine of faith, as it never wanted <hi>some witnesses</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> it, so it ever had <hi>many adversaries</hi> to <hi>oppose</hi> it: <hi>The gates of bell,</hi> though they cannot <hi>prevaile against it,</hi> yet they will doe against it all the spite they can. Heresie is like that triple headed Serpent, if one head be cut off, three will arise in the place of it. And hereticks like those <hi>Romanes</hi> in their warres with <hi>Carthage,</hi> they will never be quiet, either Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, or conquered; Surely, if ever the <hi>gates of Hell</hi> were set open in <hi>England,</hi> they are now set wide open, and the <hi>Locusts of the bottomlesse pit,</hi> even cover the face of the Land. It yeelds yet some comfortable hopes unto us, that the Lord hath a most beautifull work of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation upon the wheele in <hi>England,</hi> for that the Devill and the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite are so put to it to bestirre themselves. Never did heresie and blasphemy with that whorish impudence, oppose the fundamentall truths of Gospel grace, as now they doe, but blessed be God, who hath awakened the zeale of so many <hi>faithfull servants of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> in all parts of the Kingdome to give <hi>Testimony to his truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My brethren, let us resolve not to spend our <hi>breath</hi> onely, but our <hi>blood</hi> in a good Confession, if God should call for it. <hi>Josephus</hi> hath a story worthy our observance: That when <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> would have inforced the statue of <hi>Nero</hi> into the Temple of the Jewes, the zeale of the people inkindled against it, it being against the law of their holy Religion, <hi>Pilate</hi> purposing to inforce that by the Sword, which his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102330:15"/>Rhetorick could not perswade, drew them into a place, where he had laid an Ambuscado of armed men, who upon his fignall, were to doe execution upon those who withstood his command. The Jewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing constant to their principle of Religion, espying their danger ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, did all as one man open their naked breasts to the pointed swords of their executioners, resolving rather upon an honorable death with the safety of their Religion, then an ignominious life with the losse of it.</p>
                  <p>The third Argument for this <hi>holy Contention,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is the irrecoverable losse of our Faith being once gone. It was <hi>once given unto the Saints,</hi> and but once: It was once given unto <hi>Rome,</hi> and once unto <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and once unto the seven Churches of <hi>Asiaminor;</hi> and when once they had lost it, it was never as yet given to them again. <hi>Sol occidere &amp; redire potest:</hi> If the Sunne in the firmament doth set, it will rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but if this Sun of righteousnesse once set upon a land, an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable midnight of spirituall darknesse succeeds upon it. If we lose our estates, we may recover them again; if we lose our friends, God may raise us up some other; if we lose our lives we may exchange them for a better; but if we lose <hi>the Faith once given to the Saints,</hi> being once lost, it is lost for ever: and we lose with it our <hi>Soules,</hi> our <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> our <hi>Christ,</hi> our <hi>God,</hi> and these <hi>irrevocably.</hi> Ah deare Christians, if ever ye will <hi>contend</hi> for any thing, <hi>contend for the faith once given unto the Saints.</hi> And that is now the first object of your <hi>holy Contention,</hi> that which you should contend for.</p>
                  <p>The second is that which you should contend against: and here I shall propound two objects, first of persons, secondly of things.</p>
                  <p>First for Persons, the Royall Prophet writes us a Copie, Psal. 139.21, 22. <hi>Doe not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and doe I not ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessia contend with those that rise up against thee? yea I hate them with perfect hatred, I count them mine</hi> utter <hi>enemies.</hi> Certainly there is a generation in the Kingdom, and in this Citie (yea where is there not) whose hearts rise up against God, and against the power of godlinesse, Gods <hi>right band</hi> hath already <hi>found out many,</hi> and will certainly <hi>finde out more of those that hate him.</hi> Take heed good friends, how you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate with those against whom the Lord is ingaged. Will you be tutor'd a little from that story of <hi>Judah</hi> in <hi>Ahaz</hi> time, in the seventh and eighth Chapters of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> when prophane <hi>Syria,</hi> and Apostate <hi>Israel</hi> combined together against honest <hi>Judah,</hi> their hearts did <hi>shake</hi> as <hi>Aspy</hi> leaves: the Lord sends a Prophet to assure them, that these

                     <note place="margin">1 sa. 7.2.</note> which had more smoak then fire in them, should not hurt them;<note place="margin">Verse 4.</note>
                     <hi>Judah,</hi> though with much a-doe beleeving, prospered, and the combined Armies are scattered. Discontented <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> not humbled under Gods hand so visibly against them, resolve yet to recruit greater forces against <hi>Judah:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 9.10.</note>

                     <hi>the mighty waters of Assyria should overflow them.</hi> Now what were those waters of <hi>Siloa?

                  <p>The second object which we are to strive against, are our own lusts, <hi>striving against sin,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.4.<note place="margin">When the Scots Army was in the land.</note> Some who willingly veile their eyes, doe make some question whom they shall esteeme as enemies in these mischievous broyls invading the bowels of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

                     <hi>we should remove mountains,</hi> we should cast our <hi>Devils.</hi> Every lust is a mountain that stands up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the work of Reformation.

                  <p>In <hi>Isaiah</hi> 41.14 and 15. verses, the Lord sets a <hi>worm</hi> on work <hi>to thresh the mountains.</hi> Alas, what proportion is there between a small <hi>worm,</hi> and a huge <hi>mountain?</hi> But <hi>feare not, I am with thee,</hi> (saith the Lord.)

                  <p>Beloved, you are earnest now <hi>for a Treaty of Peace,</hi> and your seven-yeares wasting troubles do more then provoke you, but see that your faith doe call in <hi>God and his Christ</hi> unto the <hi>Treaty.</hi> See that your <hi>peace</hi> hath a <hi>word of faith</hi> to bottom upon, otherwise every storm will shake, if not overturne the sandy foundation of it.<note place="margin">Isa. 40.6, 7.</note>

Whatsoever therefore you strive against, strive especially against the unbeliefe of your own hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Against your pride, this is a proclaimed rebell against Heaven; God will have no peace with it. And little hope of a stable peace with men, if our pride stands up to wage warre with God.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth of <hi>Daniel</hi> wee reade of a tree <hi>whose height reached unto Heaven,</hi> and an <hi>Angel</hi> sent from Heaven to cut it down, but the <hi>slump</hi> of it must remaine. This tree wee finde to be the pride of the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Monarch, who gloried in the vanity of his Spirit. <hi>Is not this great Babel?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 4.30.3.15.</note> And, <hi>who is that God, that can deliver out of my hands?</hi> Such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrown trees there are too many in <hi>England.</hi> And God hath sent the <hi>Angel</hi> both of his <hi>word</hi> and <hi>rod,</hi> to cut them downe, yet some there are who stand up still against both. And those in whom this tree is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102330:17"/>out downe, have the <hi>stump</hi> yet remaining; There is some strength of this corruption in the best. Though our estates be broken, yet our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are unbroken: Though the Kingdome be rent in pieces, yet our hearts are not; though our condition below, yet our carriage is as high as ever. And as in that great Tree in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Vision,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.12.</note>
                     <hi>The beasts of the field did dwell under the shadow of it, and the birds of the ayre did lodge in the branches of it;</hi> even so there are many other lusts and corruptions, which come under the shadow and spreading bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this lust of <hi>Pride:</hi> as <hi>covetousnesse</hi> and <hi>ambition,</hi> on the one side, and <hi>passion</hi> and <hi>discontentment</hi> on the other.</p>
                  <p>He that serves these lusts, will not spare any thing that may serve them, neither with <hi>Haman,</hi> the bloud of an whole Nation, nor with <hi>Absolom,</hi> the bloud of neerest relations, nor with <hi>Herodias,</hi> the bloud of most eminent Ministers, nor conscience, nor religion, nor Christ, nor God, nor any thing that will suire his designe.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Donatus</hi> was croft in the Bishoprick of <hi>Carthage,</hi> he turned heretique, and fired the whole Empire with his faction. I feare least ambition and discontent have made many Malignants in these dayes. Shall I say as he, <hi>Fight not against small nor great.</hi> No,<note place="margin">1 King. 22.31.</note> fight against all your lusts: But above all, against this King lust, this pride of your hearts, and against all those <hi>corruptions</hi> that strengthen themselves by it. O that I could in this prevaile with <hi>London</hi> this day, <hi>fortior est qui se quam qui for tissima vincit maenia, He is stronger that ruleth his spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 16.32. <hi>Colchester</hi> was then befieged.</note>
                     <hi>then be that winneth a Citie.</hi> Could you overcome these lusts of yours, you may not onely winne a Citie, but preserve and crowne your own.</p>
                  <p>My brethren take heed, how you serve their ends who do serve their own lusts: How should they govern you that cannot govern their own passions? Fleshly corruption will ever lay before us specious pretences, in all those wayes into which our pride or passion doth prompt us; but grace will ever have a jealous eye over them. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffered my passion to work, but I suffered by it, and so undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly shall all they which give way unto it.</p>
                  <p>I will only bring hither that passage of our Saviour in <hi>Luke</hi> 17. and the beginning of the chapter, where hee shewes the danger of those that give offences, and the duty of those that suffer offences.</p>
                  <p>First, for those that give offences. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> (And marke your danger you that doe it) <hi>It were better for him</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>that a Milstone were hanged about his necke, and be cast into the Sea, then that be should offend one of these little ones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:102330:18"/>
                  <p>Secondly, for those that suffer offences, your duty is to forgive, and Christ well knowing how hard this duty is to corrupt nature, how apt we are to make <hi>Peters</hi> question,<note place="margin">Matth. 18.21.,</note>
                     <hi>How oft shall we forgive?</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupates this objection, and tells us, that if every day our brother should offend us, and seven times in every day, and should as often declare himselfe to be sorry for his offence, it is our duty to forgive. Hereupon the Apostles startle, and cry out, <hi>O Lord increase our Faith,</hi> who hath saith strong enough to close with such a duty as this? Our faith can hardly work us to forgive our brother if he offends us but once; but if every day, and if seven times in every day bee doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, where's the faith that can master passion so often to forgive?</p>
                  <p>Now mark what Christ answers, <hi>If ye had faith as a grain of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard seed, ye might say unto this Sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the roots, and be thou planted in the Sea, and it should obey you.</hi> Though Christ might point to a Sycamine tree there present, yes doubtlesse, that which he did chiefly aim at, was this <hi>root of bitternesse,</hi> that corruption which is naturally in every one of our hearts, indisposing us to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation; whereby the work is as hard to forgive offences, as to root up spreading trees. Now if a grain of Mustard seed will stock up this bitter root, &amp; throw it into the Sea of forgetfulnesse, where it may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grow nor appeare more; Oh where is <hi>Londons</hi> faith then! where is this grain of mustard-seed to bee found? If ever the publick good did provoke us to exercise faith in this duty of forgivenesse, now, even now it doth.</p>
                  <p>If the glory of one man be great in passing by offences, how emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and exemplary will the glory of a City be?</p>
                  <p>In short, deare Friends, keep your eyes, your ends, your aymes heaven-ward, Christ-ward, God-ward; and whatsoever is against Heaven, against Christ, or against God, be you against it: And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is for Heaven, for Christ, for God, be you for it. And if <hi>wee walke according to this Rule, peace shall be upon us, and upon the Israel of God.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>I have now given you the Analysis of the Text, and you see there is much in it, and I have little time, I shall endeavour as well as I can, to contract much into little, and shall confine my selfe to the two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heads of the Text: <hi>Jeremiahs Content,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiahs Account.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From the first, I observe; <hi>How moderate gracious desires should be in these earthly things.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From the second; <hi>How good Ministers may upon warrantable grounds desire to remove from an unkind people.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And first, I shall apply my selfe to the first, <hi>Jeremies Content: O that I had the Cottage of a wayfaring-man in the wildernesse, that I might leave my people, and goe from them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gracious desires should be moderate in these earthly things.</hi>

                              <hi>1.</hi> Generall Doctrine.</note> I doe not say, The desires of grace should be moderate. For that is our great corruption, that in those things wherein unsatiablenesse of desire is onely lawfull, our affections are too remisse; as in spirituall and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things; and too intense in those things wherein unsatiablenesse of desire is most unlawfull: as in temporary and earthly things. And therefore I say, If our desires are gracious, they are and should be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in earthly things.</p>
                        <p>Will you please to look upon your example in the Text, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was one of noble birth, of great parts, of eminent gifts, of admirable courage, of unparalleld fidelity in his Ministery: and yet neither his birth, nor place, nor parts nor gifts, did make him ambitious: A cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage did content him who might deserve a palace.</p>
                        <p>Will you take another instance to this? It is that of <hi>Agur,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Prov. 30.8.</note>

                           <hi>Quis nisi mentis inops?</hi> You will scarce think him a reasonable man that should desire riches not to be given unto him? But stay a while, and heare his reason: <hi>Lest I bee too full.</hi> He would not have his food to become his disease. You well know the danger of surfeits, you know it, but feele it not whilest the sweet morsell is going down; but he that feares it, <hi>puts the knife unto his throat, and moderates his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.

                        <p>This World is a through-fare either to Heaven or to Hell, and whether <hi>Judas</hi> goeth to his place, or <hi>Peter</hi> to his, we all are as a ship under saile, passing swiftly to our haven, and every moment of time doth hasten us to our last home.</p>
                        <p>The travailes of men indeed are to divers ends: Some to be great, others to be rich; some for knowledge, others for wealth, [sew for grace.] And whilest for the increase of these, wee desire encrease of yeares, what doe wee desire, but that [which unto the carnall man is

                        <p>The second now that offers it selfe in the Text is this; <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> Because the peaceable retirednesse of a mean and low estate is much more desirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then the trouble and danger of an high and great; and for this I conceive, was <hi>Jeremies</hi> desire to retire into a <hi>cottage in the wildernesse,</hi> that his soule might be free from the strifes and vexations that were in <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And for this probably <hi>John Baptist</hi> might retire to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise his Ministry in the Wildernesse rather then in the Citie,<note place="margin">Luk. 3.7. to the 18.</note> because he saw so much disquiet and ungodlinesse in it, as appeares by the sharp reproofes of his Sermon to those that came out of it. And <hi>Moses</hi> doubtlesse saw some rich content in a peaceable retirednesse, that he was so unwilling to leave his private enjoyment for a publick imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his following his father in lawes sheep in <hi>Midian,</hi> to be the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> although the Lord answered all his foure doubts, and took off all his excuses in the third of <hi>Exodus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>David</hi> likewise saw very much in this, who was so willing to have changed his <hi>Throne in Israel,</hi> for a <hi>porters office in the Lords house;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psal. 84.10.</note> and reckoned <hi>one day</hi> there spent, to be better unto him, then <hi>a thousand in the tents of ungodlinesse.</hi> For his experience had taught him, that the <hi>tempter</hi> never gat so much advantage against him at <hi>his fathers sheepfold,</hi> as in his <hi>pallace at Jerusalem.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Sam. 11.2.</note> Great estates and high Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are but the bellows of pride and passion; if there be not a great measure of wisdome and grace to keep the heart down.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Solomon</hi> likewise was not unacquainted with the comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of a peaceable retirednesse,<note place="margin">Eccles. 2.8.11.</note> who had tyred himselfe in searching out the <hi>vanity and vexation</hi> of high estates: <hi>Better</hi> (saith he) <hi>is a sallat of green hearbs where peace is, then a stalled oxe and contention therewith.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Prov. 15.17.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Surely, <hi>great estates</hi> carry with them <hi>great disquiets,</hi> and not lesse in <hi>mannaging,</hi> then in <hi>getting.</hi> How much better might a man enjoy <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe</hi> in a mean and low estate? And how much better is it for a man to enjoy <hi>himselfe,</hi> then to enjoy an <hi>estate?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He discovered a rich content in himselfe, that boare for his divise a Torteis in his shell, with this Motto: <hi>Mecum habito, I dwell with my selfe:</hi> and he also, that gave another word to it; <hi>Ʋbicun{que} sum, meus sum, Wheresoever</hi> I <hi>am, I am my selfe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Seneca</hi> that divine Philosopher, that was very studious in searching out beatitudes, discovered this amongst others: <hi>Beatus est, qui id se
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102330:24"/>esse putat:</hi> he is happie that can finde his happinesse within himselfe, and Bias-like doth carry his treasure and felicity with him. It is a poore and contemptible felicity, which one fit of an ague, stone, or gout, can deprive us of: and this is the top-excellency of all earthly comforts.</p>
                        <p>It was an enigma no lesse elegant then acute of <hi>Heraclytus,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared earthly-minded-men (coveting so much to be rich and great) unto those that digged in silver-mines, who by all their hard toyle and care, got <hi>Parvum in magno,</hi> a little silver-oare in a great deale of dirty drosse: how much better is it to enjoy <hi>Magnum in parvo,</hi> a great and rich <hi>content</hi> in a mean and low <hi>estate.</hi> And as Cosmographers, who contract the whole world into a little Mappe, to enjoy all in a little; which he enjoyes, who in a little enjoyes God and himselfe, whose estate doth not possesse him, but he his estate: and whilest he is in the world, lives in Christ above it.</p>
                        <p>The wise and holy God doth not unequally dispence his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; Some have <hi>high</hi> places, and <hi>little comfort, great estates,</hi> and small <hi>content</hi> in them: others enjoy a <hi>rich and great content</hi> in a <hi>meane estate.</hi> Some with those <hi>Israelites</hi> fare daintily, and whilest the <hi>flesh is in their teeth,</hi> there is <hi>leannesse in their soules:</hi> Others with <hi>Daniel,</hi> doe <hi>eat their pulse</hi> with <hi>quiet consciences,</hi> and doe enjoy a richer content in God, and his Christ, then the whole creature can afford the worldling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
                        <p>It was an hot dispute amongst ancient Philosophers, whether a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate enjoyment, or publique imployment were more desireable? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <hi>Seneca's</hi> writings approved the publique, yet his desires lead him unto the private: when being tyred with the temptations of <hi>Nero's</hi> Court, endeavoured if he might to have enjoyed himselfe in a solitary retirednesse; And though he placed not happinesse in <hi>Contemplation,</hi> as other Philosophers did, yet in <hi>Tranquillity:</hi> which he rarely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys who aspires greatness, as he well shewed that laid down a Crown for the burthen of it.</p>
                        <p>Our Ecclesiasticall History reports of <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> that he was so affected with a peaceable retirednesse, as that he left his Bishoprick of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> to give himselfe to his private studies.</p>
                        <p>I doe not undertake to determine the question, because to a <hi>wise</hi> man, saith the Philosopher both estates may be comfortable, much more comfortable to him that is <hi>gracious,</hi> without all dispute, good the more publique it is, the more good it is: and <hi>virtus in nobili plus
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102330:24"/>placet, quia plus claret,</hi> Vertue and grace the more eminent it is, the more beautifull it is, and beneficiall not onely in its imployment, but by its example: But, where grace and wisdome is wanting to keep down lust and pride, which are the usuall pedissequas of high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and great estates, there that lazie and unthrifty adage is made good: <hi>Bene vixit qui bene latuit:</hi> It had been some kinde of good to such a man, that he had enjoyed lesse opportunities of doing good, wherein he did evill. I presume that many in these times doe wish with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> or the time may shortly come, (how soone they know not) that they might wish, they had lived in some obscure cottage in the Wildernesse, rather then to have been acquainted with those great temptations, in which their high places and imployments have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared them.</p>
                        <p>It is reported of the Hedge-hogge, which in our vulgar reproach is the character of a covetous man, that he goes to a pile of apples and gathers up as many as he can upon his prickles, and when he comes to his hole, he goes in with his <hi>prickles,</hi> but leaves his <hi>apples</hi> behinde him. How many are there that have wallowed themselves in the <hi>apples</hi> of their sweet <hi>contentments,</hi> which they have pursued with many <hi>pricks</hi> and gripes of <hi>conscience,</hi> who when they shall descend, as shortly they must, to their holes of darknesse, they must then leave all the sweet <hi>apples</hi> of their false delights behinde them, and can carry nothing with them, but the stings and stripes of a wounded consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Will you heare what they say that have gon before them, what hath pride profited us? or what hath the pomp of riches brought us? All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a poste that passeth by—but wee are consumed in our wickednesse.</p>
                        <p>Is there now, that sayes if I were not <hi>Alexander,</hi> I could wish my selfe <hi>Diogenes,</hi> if I were not called to a publique place, I could desire a private retirednesse; surely, I could desire it likewise in thy behalfe, if the Lord hath not given thee grace, to make thy place serviceable to him and to his Saints.</p>
                        <p>I have now done with the Doctrinall part of this portion of the Text, to wit, <hi>Jeremies Content,</hi> and I shall give you a very short ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it.</p>
                        <p>And first, whither shall I look? Shall I look off from my selfe, <label type="milestone">

Surely my brethren, there is scarce a mothers sonne in this Congregation, that lies not under the just rebuke of this truth: I mean for our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102330:25"/>desires of these earthly things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Esaus hands</hi> we see every where hunting after the prey, <hi>&amp; quoquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo rem,</hi> all is good fish with the most, that comes to the net: but where doe we heare <hi>Jacobs voyce?</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Gen. 33.11. Phil. 4.11.</note>
                           <hi>The Lord hath had mercy on me, and I have enough.</hi> Or that of <hi>Paul,</hi> a Christian; <hi>I have learned in whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever estate I am, therewith to be content.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Paul</hi> a Pharisee had never learned this lesson,<note place="margin">Acts 9.4. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Gal. 1.6.</note> before he came to Christ, whose ambition hurried him to serve the lusts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at Jerusalem, in making havock of the Saints at Damascus. But when the heavenly vision had once struck downe his high thoughts, which lay with his body on the ground before the Lord Jesus; then, and not till then,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> had he learned all to be losse unto him, and Christ onely his gain.</p>
                        <p>Christians, we speak much of contentment, and it is usuall to say, <hi>I thank God I am content with what I have;</hi> but certainly, if thou art not brought over from the world unto Christ, and doest not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy thy selfe in him, thou didst never yet know what contentment meaneth.</p>
                        <p>The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> seeth the worldling loading himselfe with <hi>thick clay,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Habak. 2.9.</note> and calls unto him, <hi>Woe to him that coveteth an evill cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse.</hi> There is a covetousnesse which is good, to <hi>covet</hi> (as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit directs us) <hi>the best gifts,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.31.</note> and be you herein as covetous as your hearts can hold, and spare not. But there are other gifts which the Heathens call gifts of Fortune, because of their inconstancy: and of these is the evill covetousnesse, to covet to make <hi>the House great,</hi> and not <hi>the heart good.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Habak. 2.10.</note> The same Prophet calls to such and tells them in plain language, that they <hi>consult shame to their own house.</hi> But how is that, you will say? Without all question, the covetous man takes counsell within himselfe, with <hi>Edom,</hi> to build his Nest on high: hee consults nothing but glory to his House; but consulting not with God and his Word in his wayes, the wise and holy Providence turns his counsels into foolishnesse, and the glory of his House into shame.</p>
                        <p>Little do many think how soon and how sad the Accounts may be to them and to their families, who have raised their houses by the undoing of their brethren. Some that have willingly emptied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to make them full, and others that have been drained by them to make their morsels fat, and their cups to over-flow. <hi>He hath swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down riches,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Job. 20.15.</note> (saith <hi>Zephar</hi> in <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>and he shall vomit them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;</hi> but when <hi>Judas</hi> would have vomited up his prize of blood, it</p>

                        <p>This is all I shall say more to this point, He onely is a poore man that is ever in wants, and he is ever in wants that covets to be rich: and, which is farre worse, a worse tyrant there cannot bee then a mans own lusts, nor a worse flave then he that serves it. And what doth he that covets to be rich having a sufficiency, but covet to serve his unsatisfied lust; at least as he that weares a thin silk cloake up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a thick fur'd gown, doth shew the wantonnesse of his spirit, not any usefull imployment he makes of it: even so when superfluity and not necessity doth excrutiate the soule with worldly cares, it argues the mind full of vanity, and the heart full of pride.</p>
                        <p>But secondly, I would rather exhort you, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> and O that I had argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment strong enough to perswade the worldlings reason, that there is reason enough hee should be perswaded to moderation: If from nothing else, yet from the things themselves which he so much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets.</p>
                        <p>For first, Riches and great estates, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> at their best cannot make the possessors thereof better: nay, he must be exceeding good, that is not made much the worse by them; for hee that travelleth in his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, <hi>walketh upon snares,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Tim. 6.9.</note> and had need of much grace to keep his soule, that he be not entangled and undone by them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, look upon thy prosperity and glory at the highest, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it is but as thy shadow in the Sunne, the least cloud over-casts it at high noon; and that which in the morning is before thee, in the evening is behind thee: and all is but <hi>mane &amp; vesper,</hi> of adayes continuance, so soon passeth it away, and we are gon.</p>
                        <p>O that these reasons now, would make your reason to yeeld to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remies Content:</hi> a <hi>Content</hi> suitable to your mortall <hi>Condition. O that I had the Cottage of a wayfaring-man in the wildernesse.</hi>

                        <p>That was the first Generall of our Text, which I have now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed, <hi>Jeremies Content:</hi> I had a desire to have given you his <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> why he desired his <hi>Cottage in the wildernesse, That I might leave my people, and go from them.</hi> But I know the limits of your time in these morning Exercises, and I shall not exceed.</p>

Surely, say some, the fault must neede be the Ministers that his people are so bad; for <hi>da Ambrosins &amp; habebis Theodasios:</hi> Let the Minister be good, and the people will be easily wrought unto good by him: But either his life is amisse, or his labours too remisse; either he is too loose, or too precise in his conversation; or too profound, or too plain in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; either he wants bountifulnesse, or peaceablenesse, humility or familiarity: Or perhaps the people may want themselves in all these.</p>
                        <p>I deny not but the fault may be somtimes the Ministers, &amp; good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters may have their faults, and his discomfort sure it is, that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are no better,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> and his discomfort is the peoples disprofit: <hi>Obey them that have the oversight of you, and submit your selves, for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may doe it with joy, and not with grief, for that is unprofitable unto you:</hi> unprofitable unto you (saith the Apostle) that you should make their lives grievous, who spend their lives to make yours good.</p>
                        <p>But say my beloved, shew me the fault if you can, in <hi>Jeremies</hi> life, or labour, and yet his people so bad, as that he was not onely weary of them,<note place="margin">

                        <p>Give me leave now to make some short application of this point, and I have two words to say, to People, to Minister.</p>

                        <p>Yet one word more, (good people) beare, and I pray beare with your Ministers complainings under your unprofitablenesse: for surely their discomforts are exceeding great, not as you give out, for their want of outward comforts: [For without all question, God will never leave a godly Minister unprovided for. If he straghten him in one place, he will make room for him in another.] But because Gods glory and your soules are dearer unto them then their lives. <hi>Moses</hi> for the glory of Gods name, was contented to have his owne blotted out of the book of life;<note place="margin">Exod. 32.32. Rom. 9.3.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> for the salvation of many, was prest in zeale to have parted with his own.</p>
                        <p>Nay, beloved, I will speak a bold word and a true, your soules are much dearer unto your Ministers, then they are unto your selves. For did you bestow but halfe those paines and cares about your own soules, which they bestow upon yours, how good, how much better would they be!</p>
                        <p>How prodigall are many of the sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> to barter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the pretious purchase of Christs blood for an Apple, their Birth-right for a messe of pottage, their soules upon every slight temptation, when it costs their Minister many a night watches, many a painfull swets, many a carefull thoughts, and heavy Ephialts, to recover the spoile out of the strong mans hands again.</p>
                        <p>To my fellow-labourers in the Gospel, <label type="milestone">

                        <p>A word more I have to my fellow-sufferers, who are discomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly matcht with an unkinde and untractable people, though their comfort be lesse then others, yet their reward may not: for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is not according to our successe, but according to our labours. <hi>I have laboured in vaine, I have spent my strength for nothing;</hi> saith Christ, saith <hi>Esay: But my Judgement is with the Lord, and my work with the most High.

                        <p>The clouds doe kindly serve divine providence in dropping down their fatnesse, though the earth be not fruitfull, and the Sunne in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out his influences, though the clay be hardned; should wee cast our pearles before swine? Which doe not onely refuse our pearles, but rend our persons. Our pearles are not the lesse precious, nor our kindnesse the lesse acceptable unto Jesus Christ; for whose sake wee both labour and suffer.</p>
                        <p>I remember a passage between Christ and <hi>Peter,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luke 5.4, 5.</note> Christ coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Peters</hi> ship to preach, after he had don his Sermon, bad <hi>Peter</hi> to cast out his net into the Sea, for a draught of fish, why Sir, saith <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> I have fisht all night, and have caught nothing; neverthelesse, at thy command, I will let down the net. And the holy Story saith, <hi>He enclosed a great multitude of fishes.</hi> You know what Christ intended in this, to shew <hi>Peter</hi> what he should expect when he should shortly be made a fisher of men. He might fish all night, and all day too, and catch nothing, if Christ be not with him: neverthelesse, having a word of command from Christ, he must doe his worke, and waite upon Christ for the word of his blessing.</p>

                           <hi>O that I had the cottage of a wayfaring man in the Wildernesse, that I might leave my people. My people,</hi> saith <hi>Jeremy.</hi> But how so. The Prophets were not assigned unto peculiar charges, as the Priests were at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the Levites unto their particular Cities; and yet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy's</hi> delegation wee shall finde to be chiefly to the head Citie, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by Chapter the first of this Prophecy, and ver. 18. Where his Commission is directed unto the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and to the Princes and Priests that were in <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> In order whereunto wee shall reade Chapter 5 ver. 1. and 5. He went up and down the streets of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> to finde out one righteous and pious man. Upon this ground it is not improbable that he calls those of <hi>Jerusalem my people,</hi> to distinguish them from those in the Wildernesse of <hi>Judea,</hi> of <hi>Ziph,</hi> or of <hi>Maon;</hi> into some one of which he might desire to remoove: <hi>O that I had the cottage of a wayfaring man in the Wildernesse, that I might leave my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> But whether wee confine <hi>Jeremy's</hi> Dioces unto <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it over all <hi>Judea,</hi> a propriety of relation he had, and every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hath in that people to whom the Lord doth send him.</p>

                           <hi>Paul</hi> claimes as genuine and naturall right in his <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi>

Notwithstanding it was not <hi>Paul</hi> that did beget the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but the Lord by him. Nor was it he that did bring forth the new creature in the <hi>Galatians,</hi> but the Spirit by him. Such is our good Lords condescension unto his worthlesse Ministers, as that he doth oft times in Scripture transferre over, as it were his right unto his Ministers, by ascribing that unto their power, which belongs unto his own, and allowing them to assume that right in his people, which none can truly challenge but himselfe; as he saith to <hi>Moses,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Deut. 9.12.</note>

                        <p>A word of use to this. <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>1</label> Surely the interest is very great between Minister and people, and the bond very strickt, both to enforce the Ministers care, and the peoples love, nor can indeed the Minister be carelesse, or the people unloving, if this propriety of relation be laid home.</p>

                        <p>I conceive, they urge it by much too farre, that would have it as fixt and absolute, as between man and wife, To have and to hold, for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse, till death us depart.</p>
                        <p>Be the Ministers condition or peoples carriage what it will, the Minister in their opinion can no more lawfully leave his people, then a man his wife. Would these likewise allow the wife, to have no right in what is hers, but what is her husbands? I trow they would not.

                        <p>But grant the relation to be so fixed, as between man and wife, yet there are some cases in which man and wife may separate: And that is now our Third labour to finde out that case.</p>

                        <p>When <hi>John Baptist</hi> sent his Disciples to know of Christ, <hi>Whether he were the Messiah, or whether they should look for another;</hi> Christ told them of the Wonders which were done by him: <hi>The deafe heare, the blind receive their sight, the dead are raised to life,</hi> and amongst other wonders of his Kingdome, he brings in this with (if not above) the rest; <hi>The poore receive the Gospel:</hi> Our latter English reads it,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.5.</note>

                        <p>It was no Paradox to him that said; The Devill hath more a doe to winne the simple, then the subtile, and the Minister lesse: Because the worldly wise are sooner enraged by the Ministry of the Word, then wonne by it: For that the Ministry of the Word crosses with the contentments of the world, and the wisdome of the Spirit bids open warre against the wisdome of the flesh; Whereas in the poore and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant temptations against the Word being lesse, the entertainment of it is easier.</p>

                        <p>That decree in Paradise of enmity between the Womans and the Serpents seede,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> is both literally and mystically true. The naturall seede is not so envious to man, but the supernaturall is much more envious to the Christian man. The Woman in the twelfth of the <hi>Revelation</hi> fled for her security into the Wildernesse, and her blessed man-childe the Lord Christ was safe in the Wildernesse, who suffered in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.

                        <p>My Brethren, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>1</label> Let us all take this home, and wonder what wee are by nature. The kingdome of Jesus Christ in the 11. of <hi>Isa.</hi> is set forth by wilde beasts changed from the rabidnesse of their natures, and the kingdomes of men in the 7. of <hi>Daniel</hi> by wilde beasts that doe continue
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102330:33"/>and exercise their native fiercenesse: the kingdomes of men will prove little better then the kingdomes of beasts, where the kingdome of Christ is opposed. <hi>Homo homini lupus:</hi> there is no beast more savage by nature then man is, unlesse the Kingdome of Christ doth either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate or restrain him.</p>
                        <p>There is much in that, &amp; I desire it may be noted, the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do often tutor the reasonable <hi>man</hi> by unreasonable <hi>beasts;</hi> because man being in honor little lower then the Angels, by his fall became worse than beasts: Beasts yeelding that obedience to God, and service to man, which men deny both to God and man. <hi>Basil</hi> of <hi>Seleucia</hi> not improperly observes, that the beasts before the flood were more tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable to the command of God, and to the ministery of <hi>Noah,</hi> then the men of the old world were; for they entred into the Ark and were saved, the other refused, and perished.</p>
                        <p>Let us think how dreadfull the day will be, <label type="milestone">

The house infected is their finne, the house on fire is their judgement; and in as much as we are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of their sinnes,<note place="margin">Rev. 18.4.</note> we shall be partakers of their judgements. <hi>Jeremy,</hi> to avoid both, desired to retire with safety into the wildernesse, rather then to live in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with fire over his head: <hi>O that I had the Cottage of a wayfaring-man in the wildernesse, that I might leave my people and goe from them.</hi>

                        </list>
                        <p>Now I charge none with these, but shall shew how lawfull the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall is where these may be charged.</p>
                        <p>The first provocation of the people is;<note place="margin">

Of this our Prophet complains, Chap. 5. v. 12. That the men of <hi>Judah</hi> had belied the Lord their God, and accounted the words of his Prophets as wind. And Chap. 8. v. 9. They had rejected the word of the Lord, and there was no understanding left in them.</p>
                        <p>Now this is a very sad provocation unto a Minister, which may not unjustly occasion his removall, as appeareth by that clause in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters commission, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. v. 10, 11. <hi>Into whatsoever Citie you enter, and they receive you not, goe your wayes into the streets of the same, and say, even the very dust of the Citie which cleaveth on us, we doe wipe off against you.</hi>

And in Acts 22. v. 18. The Lord charged the Doctor of the Gentiles to make hast, and to get him quickly out of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> upon this ground, because, saith be, <hi>they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</hi> And when <hi>Paul</hi> had a great desire to stay at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as appeares by his reasoning with the Lord, v. 19. and 20. No, saith Christ, do not plead for thy stay, but haste thee to be gone, for I have a purpose to remove thee <hi>farre hence to the Gentiles,</hi> vers. 21. What should God doe with such a people with whom his Word can doe no good? If they say to God, <hi>Depart from us, we will have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy wayes,</hi> it is time for God to say to his Ministers, Depart from them. <hi>Ex ore suo,</hi> out of their own mouth will I judge this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, because they would not have the knowledge of my wayes, they shall not. And this is now their first provocation, their untractable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the ministery of the Word.</p>
                        <p>The second provocation in the people is,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Jer. 38.9. 1 Cor. 9.13.</note> Their unmercifulnesse in with-holding maintenance from their Ministers. The Princes of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem would have starved <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the Dungeon, if an Aethyopian had not been more pittifull unto him then any Israelite was.</p>
                        <p>Maintenance is allowed on all sides,<note place="margin">V. 7.9.</note> that he who <hi>waits</hi> at the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> should <hi>live</hi> by the <hi>Altar.</hi> And the Apostle makes it out by divers arguments drawn from Natures laws, and if men would but measure the <hi>quotum</hi> by halfe that allowance which they give to one lust, they would be more reasonable in judging what were a competency.</p>
                        <p>It is a great provocation when people with-draw their affections from their Ministers, and bestow them on those who with-draw their soules from the truth, as those <hi>Galatians</hi> gave their hearts to such as plucked out their <hi>spirituall eyes,</hi> who a little before would have spluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out their <hi>corporall eyes</hi> to have given <hi>Paul.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Gal. 4.15.</note> But when people also with-draw maintenance the bond of covenant between Minister and people is broken. For though the Covenant be not alwayes expressed, yet it is alwayes implied, that the people, <hi>plus multo,</hi> should bee as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and as <hi>certain</hi> unto the Minister in <hi>temporals,</hi> as the Minister unto them in <hi>spirituals,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. v. 11.</p>
                        <p>The Civill law allowes the wife (and if it did not, the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102330:35"/>doth) receiving not <hi>victum,</hi> livelihood from him to whom she is a helper, to seek <hi>alimentum,</hi> subsistence elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The third provocation in the people is Apostasie,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>3.</hi> Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and this <hi>Jeremy</hi> charges double on <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> both in worship and in practice: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the one, in the words below my Text, he calls them <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and Adulteresses:</hi> In reference to the other, <hi>an assembly of evill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> What <hi>adultery</hi> is to the Marriage-contract, that is Apostasie to the Gospel-covenant, and no adultery like to the adulterating of the truth and worship of God.</p>
                        <p>Now Apostasie is a grievous provocation unto the Lord himself to depart from a people.<note place="margin">Hos. 9.12.</note>
                           <hi>Woe unto them when I shall depart from them,</hi> (saith the Lord.) And when is that? When they depart from his truth and worship. And where the Lord goes, the servant goes after; If the <hi>Son of Peace</hi> abide not in the Citie,<note place="margin">Luke 10.6, 10.</note> the <hi>Embassadors of peace</hi> must depart, and their <hi>peace</hi> departs with them.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. v. 38. the Apostle brings in the Lord protesting against Apostates, <hi>If any man draw back, my soule shall have no pleasure in him.</hi> Draw back from what? The former words run thus, <hi>The just shall live by faith,</hi> and if any man draw back, that is, from faith, either from the doctrine of faith, or from the life of faith, from Gospel <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> or Gospel <hi>Conversation,</hi> my soule shall have no pleasure in him: <hi>Non erit rectus in anima mea:</hi> He shall not stand right in my affection, I shall on no tearmes approve him: yea the words are a <hi>melosis,</hi> there is much more implied then is expressed, My soule shall loath and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate such a person, I will not endure the sight of him in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. And if this be the case of the Congregation, the Minister may well say,<note place="margin">Jerem. 8.5. Hosea. 11.7.</note>
                           <hi>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.</hi> But this must be understood of a people turned back by a <hi>perpetual rebellion</hi> and <hi>de industria,</hi> with an <hi>heart bent to back-sliding,</hi> not through infirmity, but by a designe.</p>
                        <p>The fourth provocation is <hi>Persecution:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>4.</hi> Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> And Apostates soon turne persecuters, <hi>&amp; solus Apostata persecuter;</hi> they usually become the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, because they are loath to have that way to bee credited, from which they are revolted. <hi>Julian</hi> that was the most notorious <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,</hi> became the most bitter <hi>Persecutor</hi> that ever lived in the Christian Church.</p>
                        <p>There are two sorts of persecution, which the red Dragon stirres up against godly Ministers, <hi>Oris &amp; plagae, Ishmaels</hi> and <hi>Esaus</hi> perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, Tongue-persecution, and Hand-persecution. When men do
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102330:35"/>not onely give out <hi>hard speeches,</hi> to reproach the Minister and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">Jude 15.</note> but doe seek out all advantages to intrap his person.</p>
                        <p>Now the Lord had discovered unto <hi>Jeremy</hi> the treachery of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hearts, though it were not come to blowes, chap. 11. v. 18.19. There is more danger of the wolf in the lambs skin, then in his own, and where danger is eminent, it is not onely safe, but necessary to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it. If the people receive not our <hi>testimony,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Acts 22.18. Matth. 10.23.</note> Christ would have us to <hi>depart;</hi> but if they <hi>persecute</hi> us, Christ advises us to flye. And in personall persecutions all agree with <hi>Augustine</hi> that it is lawfull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, which in generall persecutions they question as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his Apologie to the Emperour, on this ground justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his departure from <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the persecution of <hi>Constantius,</hi>

                        <p>You see now the provocations of the people, which may warrantize their <hi>Jeremies to depart from them,</hi> and to wish for retiring Cottages in the wildernesse. <hi>O that I had the Cottage of a wayfaring-man in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, that I might leave my people, and goe from them.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>These two intimations wee have from those two holy advantages which <hi>Jeremy</hi> aymed at in his cottage in the wildernesse.</p>
                        <p>The first was an holy retirednesse unto prayers and teares, for <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>he wishes his eyes a fountain of teares;</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and in the Text he wishes for some solitary place to powre them out in. It is not enough to pray, but we should pray in teares, and to pray in teares, we should retire our selves to it as to our worke.</p>
                        <p>Could I here reach my brethren in their Cottages, I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speake from them this holy improvement of their retirednesse, to pray for those whom they have left, those that are at ease in <hi>Sion,</hi> that drink their wine in bowles, and forget <hi>Joseph</hi> in the stocks. It is an happy leasure wherein wee are set on work for God, and a blessed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration from the world, by which wee have more commerce with Heaven.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                           <hi>Jeremy</hi> foreseeing <hi>Jerusalems</hi> misery, wishes himselfe in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse that he might not see it; as good old <hi>Cato,</hi> hearing of <hi>Romes</hi> overthrow, being blinde and uncapable to see it, wished himselfe deafe too, that he might not have heard it.</p>
                        <p>The miseries of unkinde people as they are better discerned, so they are more pittied by good Ministers, then by themselves. The Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian sees more into the danger of the patient, then the patient him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe doth, and when the patient desires such things as would kill him, the Physitian studies all meanes to cure him. The watchmen on the walls, see further then those in the Citie, and though the people doe rest secure in their sinnes, yet they that watch for their soules will not suffer God to be at rest for them. <hi>Moses</hi> is contending with God for <hi>Israels</hi> safety, when <hi>Israel</hi> was dancing before their Idoll, senlesse both of their sinne and judgement approaching.</p>
                        <p>My Brethren, I will onely say of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Abel,</hi> being dead

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102330:40"/>the marks of this direfull wrath, the Spirit of God doth notably point them out unto you, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>They are the men that have transgressed my Covenant, which have not performed the words of the Covenant which they made before me, when they did cut the Calfe in twaine, and passed between the parts thereof.</hi> This was a ceremony used amongst the <hi>Jewes</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenants, wherein they did tacitly imprecate the holy God, even so to cut them in pieces who did breake the Covenant, as they did cut the Calfe, and as they did passe between the divided pieces, so the Lord to cause his fiery indignation, to passe between them who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided one from the other in the bond of the holy Covenant.</p>
                        <p>And now my Brethren, if the most just God be so extreamly severe in breach of Covenants between man and man, how think you will he make his jealousie to smoake against those that break Covenant with himselfe in those things which doe most neerly concern his worship, and the glory of his Name.</p>

                        <p>In the beginning of this Parliament wee admired to see how <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was turned Arminian, and how neere it was got of a sudden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102330:41"/>
                           <hi>Rome,</hi> wee have now more cause to wonder, how <hi>Rome</hi> is come into <hi>England,</hi> and how <hi>England</hi> is turned Libertine, Pelagian, Socinian, Antinomian, Antiscriptarian, Antitrinitarian; yea it hath had so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny turnings, as that turning unto Christ by repentance and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is now turned out of doores, and throwne aside as an old dotage of legall servitude, wee know not whether the tyranny of Bishops, or treachery of seducers, have done <hi>London, England,</hi> most hurt: for the one kept from us <hi>the power of godlinesse,</hi> the other hath beguiled us even of <hi>the forme of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Shall I tell you (and with reverence I would) that our apostasie from God, hath caused God even to apostatize from us. I speake in the same sense, as God speaks of himself that <hi>he repents</hi> and <hi>is sorry</hi> for what he hath done. God was in a very faire way to have refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>England,</hi> he had cast us in, as rich advantages, as ever any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or age was betrusted with. He had awaked the zeale of all his faithfull ones in three Kingdomes; he had contributed the counsells of divers reformed Churches; he had broken the strength of all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, and because wee have apostatized from our former zeale, God hath also turned back from his; Divine Justice holds proportion with our sin, because we have said, the time of reformation is not yet come; God hath stept aside from us, and said, well, if you let goe this, you shall never have such a time more.</p>
                        <p>Those that observe the Story of the Eastern Churches, doe alledge this as the great provocation of Gods wrath to bring upon them the blasphemous doctrine of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> because they rejected the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some truths of the Gospel. When once we begin to nauseate at old truths, and (as flies about a Candle) to play about new lights, it is a thousand to one but wee singe our wings, if wee burne not our selves, before we get off.</p>
                        <p>The least backsliding is in attendancy to totall and finall apostasie, and when wee once look back, wee have no more power to turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout againe, then <hi>Lots</hi> wife, who was instantly made a monument of her own revolt.</p>
                        <p>I will close this with that of the Apostle,<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.25.</note>
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Take heed bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, least there be in any of you an evill heart of unbeliefe, to depart from the living God:</hi> This evill heart reignes in some, dwells in the best, it is the mother of all finne, but apostafie is its primogenite, this begins in contempt of Ordinances; for such is the departing here, <hi>a farsaking of the holy Assemblies,</hi> as elsewhere the Apostle doth interpret himselfe,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102330:41"/>and this he calls <hi>a departing from the living God,</hi> because God in every Ordinance might be enjoyed where there is faith to bring him home; now this God lives to take vengeance on all those that depart from him, therefore take heed how yee provoke this living God, by despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his Ordinances, and discouraging his Ministers, and so departing from him in the law of his Gospel-worship. This is the second Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</p>
                        <p>My third Counsell is that of the 32. Canon of the Councell of <hi>Towers: Let all men study peace, but especially Christians.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>3</hi> Counsell.</note> Christians if there be any thing of Christs Spirit in you, lay aside that gall and wormwood, that bitternesse of spirit and heat of contentions that is in the midst of you. Whatsoever differences there are between you in things disputable, yet let unity be preserved in things fundamentall; nothing makes your Ministers lives more uncomfortable amongst you, or their Ministry more ineffectuall, nothing so much disgraces Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or obstructs the beautifull birth of reformation, then the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie discords of those who are accounted godly in your Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>I doe not plead for <hi>Baal,</hi> that there should be any agreement with <hi>Rome</hi> in those superstitious Ceremonies or corrupt doctrines which are happily exploded our Assemblies. No; such compliance would prove <hi>Englands</hi> undoing: as our Ecclesiasticall History well observes, That, that <hi>Bulla consensus,</hi> agreement which the Greek Church made with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in their opinions, was an evill presage of the utter ruine of the Orientall Empire, and of that famous Citie of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> which immediately followed thereupon: But as it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Polycarpus</hi> and <hi>Amicetus,</hi> howsoever they differed in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about some things, and could not be reconciled, yet they kept fast the bond of Christian fellowship in the faith of Jesus. Even so (my Brethren) let us as many as love <hi>Jerusalems</hi> peace lay aside our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in smaller matters, and study how to preserve our unity in the maine; <hi>Follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edifie another.</hi> Rom. 14.19. <hi>Let us therefore follow faith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle;</hi> he had laid the foundation of his exhortation in two argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments foregoing.</p>

                        <p> It is said of <hi>Basil</hi> the great, that in those differences between <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and him, he overcame him by courtefie, and humanitie. O that wee also could strive in love and humility, to goe one before the other, and to overcome our differences, not by bitter disputes, but by an humble condescension. Methinks wee should not own our selves to be Christs Disciples, and to have learned nothing of that prime lesson of his,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.29.</note> wherein he gives us both his counsell and example; <hi>Learne of me, for I am meeke and lowly in heart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As long as the professors of the true faith in <hi>Constantinople</hi> (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever differing in points of Discipline) held love and fellowship toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in substantials of doctrine and worship, so long they became a fence unto their Citie against the publique enemy: But when once they brake asunder in unkindly divisions, and shortly after lost both truth and worship, both parties became a spoyle to those that hated them.</p>
                        <p>The like unhappy Story wee finde of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when those two Christian Governours <hi>Guido</hi> and <hi>Raimundo,</hi> with their parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended amongst themselves, they gave occasion to the common adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to come in, and take from them both, not onely the Citie, but the Gospel to boote. I beleeve you doe not forget what lately I delivered unto you upon another subject, That there is a generation of <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> and <hi>Perezites</hi> amongst us, that doe wait for the opportunity of <hi>Abrams</hi> and <hi>Lots</hi> divisions, to break in upon us, and to spoile us of all our Gospel-priviledges and liberties. Methinks if any thing would prevaile with us, nothing should more inforce us to agreement then this mischiefe which is like to follow our disagreement; we shall both sides become a prey to those that maligne us.</p>
